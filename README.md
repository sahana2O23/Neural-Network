Project: Neural_Network 


Contains the implementation of a neural network model with two hidden layers.

Implemented the following activation functions: ReLu, Tanh, and Softmax.

Implemented the following loss functions: Mean squared error and Categorical cross-entropy.

Tested the model with MNIST data. Also, implemented a neural network model using tensorflow to compare performance.
