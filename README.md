Project: Neural_Network 


Contains the implementation of a neural network model with 2 hidden layers.

Implemented the following activation functions: ReLu, Tanh, and Softmax.

Implemented the following loss functions: MSE, and Categorical Cross Entropy.

Tested the model with MNIST data. Also, implemented a neural network model with tensorflow to compare performance.
